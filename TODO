- we need to make reduce_iter work even without by_blocks
    ---> especially now that it is used in prefix example
- we need to double check performance gains for filter_collect
    ---> why gains on desktop but not on laptop ? is it cache size ? do i take right size ?
    ---> we need to get back the task hover in the logs
- is it ok to have an Option in by_blocks:26 ?
  i guess it is ok because we have few blocks.
  it was introduced because the prefix use rayon::current_thread_index
  and it was called from outside the pool

- there is a bug in prefix at blocksize of 100_000_000 or more
    ---> check that final list iterator as only one element
- block sizes have 0 impact in performance in prefix
   ----> my guess is that reduce_iter is bad without by_blocks
